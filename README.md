## NodeJS Supercomputing

Join me in a wild adventure to take a computationally heavy single-use NodeJS application and automagically scale it across many cores and many servers in the hunt for lazy performance. Disclaimer: This is all for fun, games and science.

**This is very rough around the edges, very filthy. Consider it a learning experience rather than anything sensible.**
